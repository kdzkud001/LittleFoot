Little Foot is an incentivised Carbon Footprint
Lowering app. Although the method lies in individuals
participating in carbon footprint lowering challenges
to earn points, the aim is that through this process,
participants will learn about the positive impact 
that they can have and will adopt some of these
challenges permanently#
By simply completing these challenges over the 
course of two weeks, you are showing yourself and 
others how simple it is to prioritise our environment
in a game-changing way that will undoubtedly yield 
incredible long term results!
