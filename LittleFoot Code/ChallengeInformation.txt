Little Foot challenges operate on an incentivised 
point system. Each challenge is alloted a 
certain amount of points,should you complete 
that particular challenge every day across the 2
week duration. In the event that the chosen 
challenge is only completed on certain days, a
'point installment'is added to your point total
every single day, as per the daily challenge checklist.
It is once again reiterated that honesty is vital 
and should it be discovered that you were untruthful,
you will be disqualified...
